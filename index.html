    <h2>Helpful Linux Things (I use Arch btw)</h2>
    <p>Eversince I switched to Arch Linux I found myself digging through the web and asking how to basically do anything.
    To either safe myself time or maybe a lost soul I figured I can write my experience down to have a quicker lookup later.
    Also I wanted to upload my crazy high effort 100k hour rice that definetely wasn't me asking a Clanker to change the css files for me instead of figuring out how colors fit together</p>
