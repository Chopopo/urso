    <h2>Helpful Linux Things (I use Arch btw)</h2>

    <p>Eversince I switched to Arch Linux I found myself digging through the web and asking how to basically do anything.
    To either safe myself time or maybe a lost soul I figured I can write my experience down to have a quicker lookup later.
    Also I wanted to upload my crazy high effort 100k hour rice that definetely wasn't me asking a Clanker to change the css files for me instead of figuring out how colors fit together</p>

    <h3>1. Installation </h3>
    <p>
    There are some things you should definetely do **before** installing.
    Some obvious, some are things I wish I knew beforehand.
    1. Save your data that you wanna keep (should be obvious)
    2. Get a USB-Stick that you can reliably sacrifice to boot linux up
    2.1 KEEP THIS USB-STICK CLOSE TO YOUR HEART IT WILL SAVE YOUR SWEET INNOCENT BUTT
    3. Update your BIOS beforehand. I didn't, it was a painful process cause I needed to reinstall linux again
    4. Make sure you can have an easy internet connection that has very easy login conditions
    5. Maybe don't go full throttle on your main machine right away (whoops)
    6. Get some coffee

    At last: the Installation

    I used this guide which was for the most part easy and painless except the times where I messed up because I cant copy stuff word for word apparently 100% user error

    I chose to go with Hyprland
    
    under **Option 2: Hyprland [WIP]** I switched out dolphin with nemo as I wasn't able to download dolphin.

    <h3>2. Rice </h3>
    <p>
      The ricing is fun as long as you have time / or commit a loooot of freetime to it. Luckily Reddit and Youtube provides a lot of examples and especially the 
      help of a renowned clanker formatting css files has become easier than ever. Sure my rice is far from perfect but it works for me and I can do all the things I have to do.
      For saftey reasons I have it backuped here: _TO DO ADD LINK_
    </p>

    <h3>3. Solutions to various problems</h3>
    <p>
      1. Connecting to various WIFI setups
      2. Changing fonts and setups
      3. Seeing asian characters
      4. Grub Menu says hi
      4.1. Bailing out! You're on your own now. Good luck!
